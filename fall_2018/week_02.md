## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, I finished getting the VM set up. There shouldn't be much more to do
on that front. I also got cross compilation for ARM working.

## This Week's Plan

I guess I have to get this all working on Windows now, which is going to be
difficult.

## Blocking

Nothing really.

## Notes

Still no.
