## Last Week's Accomplishments

This week, I reviewed Martin's PR. My goal is to get it merged today. I also
started playing around with QEMU. I got a basic OpenWRT guest running, and was
able to communicate with the host on a virtual serial port.

## This Week's Plan

I intend to delve deeper into QEMU, and work on creating a poof-of-concept that
allows the cube software running within QEMU to interact with the simulator
running on the host.

## Blocking

Nothing really.

## Notes

Yeah, no.
